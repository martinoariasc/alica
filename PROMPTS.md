## 📸 THE "ANTI-AI" FORMULA (For Hyper-Realism)

To avoid the "fake AI plastic look", we need to tell the camera how to behave.

**Crucial Keywords for Realism:**
*   `shot on Fujifilm GFX 100` (Medium format camera, incredible detail)
*   `Kodak Portra 400` (Natural film colors)
*   `depth of field` (Blurry background)
*   `natural uneven texture` (Imperfections make it real)
*   `soft window light` (No artificial studio lights)

**General Formula:**
`[LINK] [PROMPT] shot on Fujifilm GFX 100, natural light, 8k --iw 2 --style raw --v 6.0`
